            We have all heard that we need exercise. So why aren’t you motivated to exercise?
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite your best intentions, you might have a tragic case of “I’ll do it tomorrow” syndrome. You put it off until you “feel like it.” But then tomorrow arrives, and you still don’t feel like it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why? There could be many causes. Perhaps exercise is unfamiliar to you, or you haven’t found a way to make it fit into your schedule. Maybe you aren’t a morning person, but your evenings are too packed to sneak in an hour at the gym.

            Whatever the case, it’s time to address it. Otherwise, you’re missing out on its many health benefits. Exercise can make you feel energized, improve your confidence, and help you lead a healthier lifestyle. And a recent study reported in the New York Times found that even the healthiest diet won't help you live longer or prevent disease without also incorporating exercise.

            It can even boost your mental health. It’s been known to increase focus and attention, fight anxiety, and act as a natural treatment against depression. For me, I show up better in my life when I get regular exercise. Exercise helps moderate my mood and keep a more positive outlook, enough so that my family gladly prioritizes my exercise time.

            So let’s explore this connection between exercise and mental health.

            Exercise and mental health: How do they relate?

            The impact of exercise on mental health has been a hot topic for research. The science is clear: Regular exercise can improve mental and emotional well-being and lower your risk of mental illness. In fact, the CDC says you can experience benefits for your mental and physical health with as little as 30 minutes of moderate exercise per day.
