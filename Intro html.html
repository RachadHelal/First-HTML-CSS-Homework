            We have all heard that we need exercise. So why aren’t you motivated to exercise?
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite your best intentions, you might have a tragic case of “I’ll do it tomorrow” syndrome. You put it off until you “feel like it.” But then tomorrow arrives, and you still don’t feel like it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why? There could be many causes. Perhaps exercise is unfamiliar to you, or you haven’t found a way to make it fit into your schedule. Maybe you aren’t a morning person, but your evenings are too packed to sneak in an hour at the gym.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whatever the case, it’s time to address it. Otherwise, you’re missing out on its many health benefits. Exercise can make you feel energized, improve your confidence, and help you lead a healthier lifestyle. And a recent study reported in the New York Times found that even the healthiest diet won't help you live longer or prevent disease without also incorporating exercise.

            It can even boost your mental health. It’s been known to increase focus and attention, fight anxiety, and act as a natural treatment against depression. For me, I show up better in my life when I get regular exercise. Exercise helps moderate my mood and keep a more positive outlook, enough so that my family gladly prioritizes my exercise time.

            So let’s explore this connection between exercise and mental health.

            How does exercise improve and benefit mental health? 
        </h2>
        <p>
            The effects of exercise are hardly magic. There’s a direct relationship between your body and brain, so taking care of one helps take care of the other.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are the primary mechanisms through which exercise leads to better mental health:

            <strong><li class="happy hormonoes">Happy Hormones</li></strong>
            <p>Through regular physical activity, your body releases chemicals such as dopamine and endorphins. These hormones are responsible for most of the emotional benefits of exercise due to their capacity to create joy. That’s why they’re sometimes called “happy hormones.” They’re also known to induce euphoria in athletes, creating the phenomenon called “runner’s high.”</p>

            <strong><li class="suppressed stress">Suppressed Stress</li></strong>
            <p>In addition to producing happy chemicals, exercise reduces your body’s stress hormone levels. This means less cortisol and adrenaline running through your body, lowering your risk of chronic stress and the accompanying long-term health risks. This also has the happy side effect of improving your sleep. Less stress, coupled with a physically tired body, will help you get much-needed shuteye.</p>
            <strong><li class="Strengthened Circadian Rhythm">Strengthened Circadian Rhythm</li></strong>
            <p>
                Physical activity can be as effective as prescription sleep meds — especially if you do it outside. Outdoor workouts expose you to natural light, which signals your circadian rhythm when wind down. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Plus, when you sleep well, you get to enjoy a whole other set of health benefits:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stronger immune system</li>
                <li>Lowered risk of diabetes and heart disease</li>
                <li>Lower blood pressure</li>
                <li>Improved mood</li>
                <li>Better decision-making</li>
                <li>Increased attention and focus</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <strong><li class="Mind-Body Connection">Mind-Body Connection</li></strong>
            <p>
                Every time you move a muscle, sensory receptors send information to your brain about what’s happening. Doing this intentionally through exercise helps your mind become more aware of your body’s position in space, increasing your physical self-awareness.
            </p>
            <p>
                And as you develop this body awareness, your perception of yourself changes. You’ll start identifying with the movements of your chosen exercise. For example, if you’re a long-distance runner, you might perceive yourself as having grit and resilience, which are qualities necessary to train for and complete a marathon or other grueling physical feats.
